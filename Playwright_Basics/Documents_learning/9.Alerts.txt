alert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs

By default, dialogs are auto-dismissed by Playwright, so you don't have to handle them.

howver we still can handle them for some validations aswell.

However, you can register a dialog handler before the action that triggers
 the dialog to either dialog.accept() or dialog.dismiss() it.

 example code:

 page.on('dialog', dialog => dialog.accept());
await page.getByRole('button').click();
