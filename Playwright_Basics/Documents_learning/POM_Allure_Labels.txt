1️⃣ ALLURE LABELS (@smoke, @sanity, @regression)

Why labels are used

Filter tests in Allure UI

Categorize tests like manual test suites

Works in addition to Playwright --grep

Allure deprecated the below struture.
import { allure } from 'allure-playwright';

allure.label('suite', 'Home');
allure.severity('critical');

NEW WAY (Playwright-native, recommended)

Use:

test.step() for steps

test.info() for labels, severity, environment, attachments

👉 This aligns Allure directly with Playwright’s test lifecycle.

------------------------------------------------------
we need to use test.info().annotations 
Example: Labels + Severity (NEW WAY)


-------------------------allure labels setup:

Create Environment File (AUTOMATIC): under Create Environment File (AUTOMATIC)
Call It Once (globalSetup)
In globalSetup.js: 
import { writeAllureEnv } from './helpers/allure-env.js';

export default async () => {
  writeAllureEnv();}
