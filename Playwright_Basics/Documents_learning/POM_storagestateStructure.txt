steps to follow for storagesate setup:
STEP 1️⃣ – Create global-setup.js (Login ONCE) - its a login once and store the state in auth.json
with this we can avoid login and logout function in each test case which we use in beforeEach/beforeAll and afterEach/afterAll.
once this setup done. we can simple write the test cases in the test page without login or logout.
INTERVIEW-READY ANSWER:

“With storageState, authentication is handled globally, 
so beforeAll and afterAll are used only for data setup and cleanup. I never use them for login or logout.”

I use Playwright projects to separate login tests from authenticated tests.
Login tests run without storageState, while other modules reuse auth.json created in globalSetup.”

beforeeach and aftereach we can use for like creating class objects.

🏆 INTERVIEW-WORTHY TAKEAWAY

You can confidently say:

“I resolved Playwright ESM config issues by identifying an incorrect Node core module import. 
In ESM, path must be imported as a namespace or default export. 
Fixing that allowed Playwright to load the config and storageState correctly.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so that once logged in we can use all the test cases to run and close it at the end. its the best way to run the tests.
STEP 1️⃣ – Create global-setup.js (Login ONCE) - its a login once and store the state in auth.json
root → global-setup.js
once setup  done This runs once before all tests.

STEP 2️⃣ – Configure Playwright Projects
This is the most important step.
📁 playwright.config.js
once setup done in playwright.config.js 
🔑 What this does
Module	Login	storageState
Login	UI login	❌ NO
Home	Skipped	✅ YES
Cart	Skipped	✅ YES

STEP 3️⃣ – Login Module (NO storageState) --> we dont need anything in login test page.

STEP 4️⃣ – Home Page (WITH storageState)

📁 tests/POM_homePageTest.spec.js
we can directly write test in homepageTest without login/logout.

we can use
