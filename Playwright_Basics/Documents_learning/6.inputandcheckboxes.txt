Input elements such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select options,
 mouse clicks, type characters, keys and shortcuts as well as upload files and focus elements.

 Text input : Using locator.fill() is the easiest way to fill out the form fields. 
 It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. 
 It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.

 CHECKBOX AND RADIOBUTTONS:

 RADIO BUTTONS:
 Using locator.check() is the easiest way to check and uncheck a checkbox or a radio button. 
 This method can be used with input[type=checkbox], input[type=radio] and [role=checkbox] elements.
check the box --> locator.check()
Assertion --> expect().toBeChecked()
Additional Assertion --> locator.isChecked().toBeTruthy. will passassertion if its checked.
Additional Assertion --> locator.isChecked().toBeFalsy. will pass assertion if its not checked.

CHECKBOXES:
//CHECKBOXES WITH ASSERTIONS: 
radio button and checkboxes we use .check() for selecting the button or checkbox.
in checkboxes we can select multiple checkboxes.
check the box --> locator.check()
Assertion --> expect().toBeChecked()
Additional Assertion --> locator.isChecked().toBeTruthy. will passassertion if its checked.
Additional Assertion --> locator.isChecked().toBeFalsy. will pass assertion if its not checked.

Selecting Multiple CheckBoxes:
first we need to locate all the checkboxes in a small array. --. this is one step.
or we can locate the checkbox in dom in a elements and using indiceofindeces with nth(i) we can do multi select.
