TEST ASSERTIONS

url link :https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions

1.Playwright includes test assertions in the form of expect function. 

10 most used assertions partically:

1. expect(page).toHaveURL(url) -- page has url
2. expect(page).toHaveTitle(title) -- page has title
3. expect(locator).toBeVisible() -- element is visible
4. expect(Locator).toBeEnabled() -- Control is enabled
    expect(Locator).toBeDisabled()  -- element is toBeDisabled
5. expect(Locator).toBeChecked() -- Radiobutton/checkbox is toBeChecked
6. expect(Locator).toHaveAttribute() -- element has attribute
7. expect(Locator).toHaveText() -- element matches text
8. expect(Locator).toContainText() -- element contains text
9. expect(Locator).toHaveValue(value) -- Input has value
10. expect(page).toHaveCount() -- list of elements has given length
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFT ASSERTIONS:
By default, failed assertion will terminate test execution. Playwright also supports soft assertions:
failed soft assertions do not terminate test execution, but mark the test as failed.
