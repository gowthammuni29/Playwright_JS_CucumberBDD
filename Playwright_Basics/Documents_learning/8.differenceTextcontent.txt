textContent()
Returns the raw text content of all child nodes, including hidden elements
Does not trigger layout like innerText()
Returns text exactly as it appears in the DOM, including spaces and line breaks
Ignores CSS styling (like display: none)
innerText()
Returns the "rendered" text content
Takes CSS into account (ignores hidden elements)
Performs layout to determine what text would be visible to a user
Normalizes whitespace (like a browser would)
More human-readable output
allInnerTexts()
Returns an array of text content for each element in the locator
Useful when dealing with multiple matching elements
Each element's text is processed similar to innerText()
Here's an example to illustrate the differences:

html
 Copy
 Insert
 Export

<div id="test">
    Hello
    <span style="display: none">Hidden</span>
    World
</div>
javascript
 Copy
 Insert
 Export

// Results would be:
const textContent = await element.textContent();  // "Hello Hidden World"
const innerText = await element.innerText();      // "Hello World"
const allInnerTexts = await element.allInnerTexts(); // ["Hello World"]
Key differences in practice:

Use textContent() when you need the raw text content including hidden elements
Use innerText() when you want what a user would actually see
Use allInnerTexts() when working with multiple elements and need each one's text separately
Performance-wise:

textContent() is fastest as it doesn't trigger layout
innerText() is slower as it performs layout calculations
allInnerTexts() is similar to innerText() but returns an array
Choose the method based on your specific needs:

For testing visible text to users: innerText()
For including hidden text: textContent()
For processing multiple elements: allInnerTexts()
