What Allure Gives You (Why teams use it)

✔ Step-wise test execution
✔ Pass / Fail per step
✔ Screenshots on failure
✔ Logs & attachments
✔ History, trends, categories
✔ Looks like manual execution report

👉 Allure replaces custom step logging
👉 test.step() becomes your main step definition

STEP 1 — INSTALL ALLURE FOR PLAYWRIGHT: npm install -D allure-playwright

STEP 2 — UPDATE PLAYWRIGHT CONFIG (ESM):
reporter: [
    ['list'],
    ['allure-playwright']
  ],

  STEP 3 — WRITE TESTS USING test.step() (THIS IS KEY)
  STEP 4 — PAGE OBJECT (NO STEP LOGGING HERE)
  STEP 5 — RUN TESTS - this will create allure-results/
  STEP 6 — GENERATE ALLURE REPORT - Install Allure CLI (once) : npm install -g allure-commandline

Generate report: allure serve allure-results OR
  allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean
allure open allure-report
